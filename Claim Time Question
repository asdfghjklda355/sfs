A "fair claim time" giveaway is a unique type of giveaway where all participants are given an equal opportunity to claim their rewards, with the claim time being consistent for everyone. This type of giveaway is designed to ensure that all participants have a fair chance of receiving their prizes, without any one individual being able to claim their reward for an extended period of time.
Enabling the "Fair claim time" feature during a giveaway ensures that users with long claim times do not unfairly monopolize rewards, but this option is exclusively available to individuals who possess the coveted title of "extremely cool admin," also referred to as administrators who have been given their own unique roles by the higher-ranked, though it's important to note that even higher-ranked administrators may sway the opinions of those with this esteemed title.
