In the server hierarchy, boosters hold a privileged position that exempts them from any and all giveaway requirements, no matter how stringent or demanding they may be. This exemption is absolute and cannot be overridden by any administrator, even those who have been granted unique own roles within the server. However, it's important to note that some high-ranked roles may be able to modify the rules regarding booster exclusions in certain situations. Nonetheless, boosters are widely recognized as key contributors to the server's success, and their support is greatly appreciated by all members of the community.
